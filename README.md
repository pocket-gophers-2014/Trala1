======

Is it a playlist? Is it a tracklist? Is it a user-manipulated widget? Is it any of these things?

Nah-- not quite.

**jRadio** is here to give you access to create music events on the fly. To allow you and those around you to dance, sing ... well, you know-- live-- all on one continually streaming sound.

A community-inspired, community-involving world of music that doesn't miss a beat.

It's up to you not to miss one either.
